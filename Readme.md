## Introduction & Procedure

The emergence of social media has given web users a venue for expressing and sharing their thoughts and opinions on all kinds of topics and events. 

Twitter, with nearly 600 million users1 and over 250 million messages per day, has quickly become a gold mine for organisations to monitor their reputation and brands by extracting and analysing the sentiment of the Tweets posted by the public about them, their markets, and competitors. 

Sentiment analysis over Twitter data and other similar micro blogs faces several new challenges due to the typical short length and irregular structure of such content. 

Two main research directions can be identified in the literature of sentiment analysis on micro blogs. 

First direction is concerned with finding new methods to run such analysis, such as performing sentiment label propagation on Twitter follower graphs, and employing social relations for user-level sentiment analysis. 

The second direction is focused on identifying new sets of features to add to the trained model for sentiment identification, such as micro blogging features including hash tags, emoticons, the presence of intensifiers such as all-caps and character repetitions etc., and sentiment topic features.
